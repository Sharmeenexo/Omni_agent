# 🤖 Omni-Agent: Intent-Based AI Gateway for BNB Chain

**Omni-Agent** is an intelligent, intent-driven assistant designed to simplify Web3 for the next billion users. Built for the **Smart Builders Challenge 2026**, it leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Account Abstraction to turn natural language into high-speed on-chain actions on **opBNB**.

---

## 🌟 Vision
Traditional DeFi is complex. Omni-Agent replaces fragmented UIs with a single chat interface. Whether it's swapping assets, managing Real-World Assets (RWAs), or automating yield strategies, users simply state their "Intent," and the agent handles the rest.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Intent-Based Execution:** Swap tokens or manage portfolios via natural language (e.g., "Invest 1 BNB into tokenized real estate").
* **Account Abstraction (ERC-4337):** Gasless transactions and social/biometric login—no seed phrases required.
* **AI-Driven Risk Guardrails:** Real-time monitoring of smart contract safety and automated asset protection.
* **Non-Fungible Agents (NFA):** Strategies are encapsulated in tradeable AI Agent NFTs (BAP-578 standard).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & BNB Integration
* **Execution Layer:** Deployed on **opBNB** for 150ms finality and ultra-low gas fees.
* **Liquidity:** Integrated with **PancakeSwap V3** on BSC for optimal routing.
* **Storage:** **BNB Greenfield** stores encrypted user preferences and AI trading "memory."
* **Development:** Built using Solidity ^0.8.24, Hardhat, and the BNB Chain LangChain AgentKit.

## 📈 Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (Q1 2026):** Testnet MVP on opBNB (Current Status).
- **Phase 2 (Q2 2026):** Mainnet launch & integration with top RWA protocols.
- **Phase 3 (Q3 2026):** Expansion into DeSci funding and cross-border payment APIs.

## 📄 Deployment Details
